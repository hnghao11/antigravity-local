# Performance Optimization Plan

## Goal Description

Reduce the loading time when users navigate to the "New Document" page. Currently, the transition is slow, likely because the heavy Monaco Editor component is bundled with the page and blocks rendering until fully loaded.

## Proposed Changes

### Client-side Optimization

#### [MODIFY] [client/app/(dashboard)/editor/[id]/page.tsx](<file:///d:/DuAnRieng/MemMart/client/app/(dashboard)/editor/%5Bid%5D/page.tsx>)

- Use `next/dynamic` to lazily load the `MarkdownEditor` component.
- Provide a custom loading component (`ssr: false`) to display a spinner while the editor code is being downloaded.
- This will allow the page shell to render immediately, giving instant feedback to the user.

#### [MODIFY] [client/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx](<file:///d:/DuAnRieng/MemMart/client/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx>)

- Add a loading state to the "New Document" button to provide immediate visual feedback upon clicking (though `Link` navigation is usually instant, the lazy loading will handle the page load part).
- Ensure prefetching is enabled (default in Next.js).

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification

1.  **"New Document" Load Time**:
    - Open the specific "New Document" dashboard page.
    - Click "New Document".
    - Verify that the page transition happens almost immediately and a loading spinner appears in the editor area before the editor loads.
    - Use Chrome DevTools "Network" tab with "Fast 3G" throttling to simulate a slower connection and clearly see the loading state.
2.  **Editor Functionality**:
    - Verify that the editor still works correctly (typing, slash commands, etc.) after being lazy-loaded.
    - Verify that saving still works.

### Automated Tests

- None required for this performance refactor, as it relies on visual perception and network loading behavior.
